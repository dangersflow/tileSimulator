Topic <\br>
  The research topic is in tile based self assembly problem. In our case, we would have 3 tile types: S, A, T; A tile is a square; Every tile type has different glue configurations, in which these tiles can stick to each other. S has a glue “a” on its east side. A has a glue “a” on its west, and east sides. T has a glue “a” on its west side. What this means is that these tiles can stick together to form “ST” lines. E.g. [S,T], [S,A,T]
Question <\br>
  Given a set of these tile types with certain counts for each tile type, what is the expected length of these ST lines, and what is the percentage of ST lines of that length.
